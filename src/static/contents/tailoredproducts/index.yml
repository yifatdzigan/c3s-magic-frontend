        info_text: "Develop software to locate relevant data sets and extract the relevant data for the water sector. The C3S SWICCA project provides a list of climate indices which are defined through direct user interaction in a range of hydrological sectors (including agriculture and flood management), and further indices are defined for the urban case studies within UrbanSIS."

        sub_title:
        info_text: "The changing risks between the recent past and the future are of great interest to the insurance industry because even slight changes in climate characteristics can translate into large impacts on risk distribution/management and expected losses. Comprehensive risk indices such as the ACRI, which integrates changes in frequency and magnitude of key climate indicators and elements of hazard, exposure and vulnerability, are crucial for decision making processes."

        title: Drought indicator
        sub_title:
        info_text: "Meteorological droughts are often described using the standardized precipitation index (SPI; McKee et al, 1993), which in a standardized way describes local precipitation anomalies. It is calculated on monthly mean precipitation, and is therefore not accounting for the intensity of precipitation and the runoff process. Because SPI does not account for evaporation from the ground, it lacks one component of the water fluxes at the surface and is therefore not compatible with the concept of hydrological drought."
