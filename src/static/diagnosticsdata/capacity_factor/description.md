The goal of this diagnostic is to compute the wind capacity factor, taking as input the daily instantaneous surface wind speed, which is then extrapolated to obtain the wind speed at a height of 100 m as described in Lledó (2017).

The capacity factor is a normalized indicator of the suitability of wind speed conditions to produce electricity, irrespective of the size and number of installed turbines. 

This indicator is provided for three different classes of wind turbines (IEC, 2005) that are designed specifically for low, medium and high wind speed conditions. 

The user can select the region, temporal range and season of interest. 

The output of the recipe is a netcdf file containing the capacity factor for each of the three turbine classes.
